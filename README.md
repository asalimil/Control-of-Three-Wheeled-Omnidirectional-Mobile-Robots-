In this project, we propose an optimal control approach using the Linear Matrix Inequalities (LMIs) for trajectory tracking control of a three-wheeled omnidirectional mobile robot. In the tracking problem, the robot should track predefined reference trajectories while there exist external disturbances on the actuation system and noises on the measuring system of the robot. First, the state space representation of the omnidirectional robot dynamics is derived based on the point-mass dynamic model. Then, we propose an LMI-based full-state feedback H-infinity optimal controller for the tracking problem. The tracking performance of the omnidirectional robot using the H-infinity optimal controller is compared with using a classical control strategy in simulations of tracking a circular and eight-shape reference trajectories. In order to evaluate our proposed controller in practice, we also implement the H-infinity optimal and the classical controllers for tracking of the circular and the eight-shape trajectories by a three-wheeled omnidirectional robot. The proposed H-infinity optimal controller guarantees the stabilization of the robot motion and attenuates the effect of existing disturbances and noises on tracking the performance of a simulated three-wheeled omnidirectional robot. The three-wheeled omnidirectional robot using the H-infinity optimal controller is able to track the reference trajectories with 47.8 % and 45.83% decrease in the pose and twist errors respectively, compared with using the classical controller. The simulation and experimental results show that our proposed LMI-based H-infinity optimal controller outperforms the classical control strategy in the attenuation of disturbances and noises on the dynamic behavior of the three-wheeled omnidirectional robot during tracking the reference trajectories.
